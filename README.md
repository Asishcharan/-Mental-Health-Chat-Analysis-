# -Mental-Health-Chat-Analysis-
I developed a Mental Health Chat Analysis system that classifies text into categories like depression, anxiety, stress, and normal. Using TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, and SMOTE for class balancing, the pipeline preprocesses chat data and predicts mental health states. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.
